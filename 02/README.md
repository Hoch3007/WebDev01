## Exercise 02
Make the "fakebook" page from exercise 01 prettier with **CSS**. 
Added some kind of navigation bar and an image slider with more cat images.  

Image slider based on: http://qnimate.com/creating-a-slider-using-html-and-css-only/
I made some minor changes and tried to understand the structure/intention of the used CSS.
